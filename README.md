🎉 What is this?

A random funny commit message generator for developers who are tired of writing
boring stuff like "fixed bug" or "added feature".
Now, let your commits say things like:

Fixed bug that only existed in my mind

Refactored code to look busy

Made the code compile, not sure if it works

🚀 Installation
npm install -g funny-git-commit

🔥 Usage

Run it in your terminal:

funny-commit


You’ll instantly get a random funny commit message 😂

Example:

> funny-commit
Oops, forgot to save before commit

<sub>Yes, your commits can be this hilarious.</sub>

🤓 Why?

Because life’s too short for boring commit messages.
Make your teammates laugh (or cry) while reading git log.

📦 For Developers

Use it inside your Node.js project:

import funnyCommits from "funny-git-commit";

console.log(funnyCommits[Math.floor(Math.random() * funnyCommits.length)]);
