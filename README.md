Tired of boring commits like  
```bash
git commit -m "fixed bug"
😴 Wake up your commits with funny, meme-level commit messages instead!

This CLI will drop 🔥 random messages that make your git logs look like a stand-up comedy show 🎤

✨ Example
bash
Copy code
$ funny-commit
👉 "Fixed bug that only existed in my imagination"
bash
Copy code
$ funny-commit
👉 "Made the code compile, not sure if it works"
bash
Copy code
$ funny-commit
👉 "Added a feature that nobody asked for"
😂 Because code might break, but laughter won’t.

🚀 Installation
bash
Copy code
npm install -g funny-git-commit

It will print a random commit message you can directly use.
